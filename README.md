# Tufty2040_Scripts
Small Repository of any Tufty scripts i write.

# glitch_badge.py
This is a replacement for the stock badge script.  It has a graphic that makes it look glitchy and wiggles the text a little to make the badge seem more alive.

# matrix_badge.py
Same glitch effect as above but with the matrix rain effect.  Color of the rain and characterset can be set within the script.
